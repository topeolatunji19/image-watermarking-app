# image-watermarking-app
This is a desktop application built with python that adds a watermark to an image and stores in as a PNG file in the 'watermarked-images' folder or any other directory specified by the user. It uses the Python Pillow Library PIL. The watermark could either be a text or logo/image and can be specified by the user using the GUI of the application. Other hints are included within the code itself.
